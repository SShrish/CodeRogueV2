<h5>Welcome to Coderogue!</h5>
<p>
    Coderogue is an online, multiplayer, roguelike game in
    which the only way to control your character (or "robot")
    is by writing Javascript code.
</p>
<p>
    Start off by creating an account, or logging in if you
    already have one. In the "Account" tab, you'll see your
    gamer handle displayed. This is how you will recognize
    yourself on the high score list.
</p>
<p>
    On the "Code" tab, you can edit the code that controls your
    robot. The game has a clock that ticks once per second. At
    each tick, your code runs in an environment that includes
    the API described on the "API" tab. Any errors, messages,
    calls to <code>console.log</code> result in entries in the
    "Log" tab.
</p>

<h5>Movement</h5>
<p>
    Your code can contain anything that is legal Javascript.
    It should culminate in a call to one of the three movement
    functions:
    <ul>
        <li><code>moveForward()</code></li>
        <li><code>turnLeft()</code></li>
        <li><code>turnRight()</code></li>
    </ul>
    The main constraint on your code is that you can't call
    more than one movement function per tick. So think of your
    code as answering the question: in the current state of the
    world, what is the right next move?
</p>
<p>
    If you call two movement functions in one tick, only the
    first one will be executed. The others will result in an
    error message on the "Log" tab. 
</p>

<h5>Keeping Track of State</h5>
<p>
    One of the challenges you will face is that each invocation
    of your code needs to figure out all over again what it
    should do next. For example, if you want to move forward
    until you hit a wall, you can't just write a loop that, you
    can only move forward one step on the current tick. But
    on the next tick, you may want to remember that you intended
    to keep moving forward.
</p>
<p>
    To make this scenario easier to handle, there is a global
    variable <code>state</code> in the environment your code
    runs in. This variable is initially set to the value
    <code>"initial"</code>. If you change this to a different
    state, such as <code>"moving"</code>, then on the next tick
    you can retrieve this value and act accordingly.
</p>

<h5>Sensors</h5>
<p>
    In order to decide what motion to take, it's useful to be
    able to ask questions about the world around you. You can
    do this with the help of five sensor functions:
    <ul>
        <li><code>getLevel()</code></li>
        <li><code>getDirection()</code></li>
        <li><code>getPosition()</code></li>
        <li><code>getExitPosition()</code></li>
        <li><code>whatsAt(pos)</code></li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    A position <code>pos = [x, y]</code> is generally a list of
    length two, where <code>pos[0]</code> is the column and
    <code>pos[1]</code> is the row, with
    <ul class="ml-5 list-unstyled">
        <li><code>
            0 < pos[0] &leq; 80
        </code></li>
        <li><code>
            0 < pos[1] &leq; 40
        </code></li>
    </ul>
    So for
    example,
    <ul class="ml-5 list-unstyled">
        <li><code>
            var dx = getExitPosition()[0] - getPosition()[0]
        </code></li>
    </ul>
    sets <code>dx</code> to be the column distance from your
    robot to the exit.
</p>
<p>
    A direction <code>dir</code> is generally an integer of
    0, 1, 2, or 3. The thing to note is that in some contexts,
    like <code>getDirection()</code>, the direction is the
    absolute heading of the robot (up, right, down, or left),
    but in some contexts, like <code>canMove(dir)</code>, the
    direction is relative to the current heading of the robot
    (forward, right, backward, or left).
</p>

<h5>Levels</h5>
<p>
    Your robot starts off on level 0. In each level, there is a
    spawn point marked by "." and a goal marked by "o". The
    chellenge is to navigate your robot to the goal as quickly
    as you can.
</p>
<p>
    Each time you reach the goal, you receive some points and
    then spawn on the next level. When you pass the last level,
    you respawn back on level 0.
</p>
<p>
    Each level has its own quirks. To see a detailed description
    of the levels, click on the "Levels" tab.
</p>

<h5>Jail</h5>
<p>
    In order to keep the server from being overloaded, it throws
    misbehaving robots in "jail." This means the robot is removed
    from the board for some number of seconds, and then respawns
    on level 0.
</p>
<p>
    There are three possible offenses:
    <ul>
        <li>Running for more than 100ms.</li>
        <li>
            Having an error that prevents your code from running.
            In this case, the error message is printed to your log.
        </li>
        <li>Staying at the same position for 60 ticks.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    On the first offense, the robot is jailed for 0-10 seconds,
    on the second offense, 0-60 seconds, on the third offense,
    0-5 minutes, and on the fourth offense, 0-60 minutes. If your
    robot ever successfully moves to a new position using
    <code>moveForward()</code> without bumping into a wall, its
    idle timer and its entire criminal record are reset.
</p>
<p>
    The other way to reset your robot is by submitting new code.
    Anytime you hit the "Submit" button, your robot is immediately
    released from jail with a clean record.
