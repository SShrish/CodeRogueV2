<h5>Level 0: The Plains</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Wide open, no internal walls!</li>
    <li>You get 100 points when you get to the exit.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Level 1: Rolling Hills</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
        There are rectangular "hills" that may block your path.
    </li>
    <li>
        The area is tectonically unstable. Hills grow, shrink,
         and move over time.
    </li>
    <li>
        Navigating around them may be tricky; see the "State" section
        on the "General" tab for some ideas.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you bump into a wall or another player, you get a bloody
        nose and lose a point.
    </li>
    <li>You get 200 points when you get to the exit.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Level 2: Moria</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Navigate your way through a cave-laced mountain.</li>
    <li>
        The caves and tunnels are magical. They shift around over time.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you bump into a wall, you get a bloody nose and lose a point.
    </li>
    <li>
        But if you bump into another player, you gain 200 points and
        bump them back to level 0. Players near spawn and exit are
        protected to avoid griefing. See the API function
        <code>isProtected</code> for an easy way to determine if a player
        can be bumped off.
    </li>
    <li>You get 500 points when you get to the exit.</li>
    <li>
        To avoid exit camping, the idle timer on this level is reduced
        to 5 seconds.
    </li>
</ul>
