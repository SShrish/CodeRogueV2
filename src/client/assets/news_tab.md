  Coderogue is back up!

  This is a preview version, starting off in the state it was in at the end of the last school year. Some of the rules of the game may change in the coming days, so consider any code you write right now to be experimental.

  Some things that I know are currently not working:
  * The Player tab

    There's supposed to be a graph showing the player's score over time.

  * The Freeze button

    On the Code tab, the freeze button is supposed to freeze the display so you can examine the game state and your log without it constantly changing.

  * Account validation

    The system is supposed to validate your @lwsd e-mail address, but that isn't hooked up yet. For now, please just use your actual e-mail, I'll check it later.
