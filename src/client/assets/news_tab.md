  Coderogue is back up!

  This is a preview version, starting off in the state it was in at the end of the last school year. Some of the rules of the game may change in the coming days, so consider any code you write right now to be experimental.

  Some things that I know are currently not working:
  * The Player tab
    Eventually it will show detailed stats per player.
  * The Freeze button
    On the Code tab, the freeze button (in the log area) should freeze the display so you can get a closer look at the current snapshot.
  * Account validation
    For now, please just use your actual @lwsd e-mail handle. Eventually it will send you an e-mail to confirm your identity, but for now we're using the honor system.
